        <h2>About Storage Fusion</h2>
        <p>
            Storage Fusion is a hybrid cloud data services solution for containers and software-defined infrastructures
            (compute, storage, and data protection all in one) for OpenShift. It can run both on premises or in the cloud of any
            of the major public cloud providers—AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud. IBM designed Storage
            Fusion to provide numerous benefits and capabilities to organizations, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to scale up and/or down with workloads, which is essential to meet the agility requirements of container-based apps.</li>
            <li>An abstraction layer of infrastructure as code for developers and platform engineers, enabling them to simplify and accelerate access to and scaling up of resources.</li>
            <li>Integrated data storage services for block, file, and object data, along with automated backup and restore.</li>
            <li>Integrated support for high availability and disaster recovery, complete with policies for application consistency.</li>
            <li>Flexible deployment as hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) on premises and as software on AWS, Azure, or IBM Cloud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Modernization Advantages of IBM Storage Fusion</h2>
        <p>
            With the integration of RedHat OpenShift technology and IBM’s data services, data protection, and infrastructure,
            IBM Storage Fusion delivers modernization-specific benefits to container-based applications in Kubernetes
            environments. For example, it can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerate innovation by better supporting developers, DevOps teams, and platform engineers. It is simple, consistent, and dynamically scalable, offering a repeatable Kubernetes experience, even across extended hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</li>
            <li>Reduce complexity and burdens on staffing with a consolidated, validated, secure HCI-based architecture, with IBM supporting the entire software and hardware stack.</li>
            <li>Provide better cost control as the environment scales, with improvements to density and efficiency, along with its integrated open source technology to help reduce the cost of licensing.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
